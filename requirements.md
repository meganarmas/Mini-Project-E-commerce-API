In today's digital age, online shopping has become an integral part of our lives. E-commerce platforms have revolutionized the way we purchase products, offering convenience, variety, and accessibility like never before. However, building a robust e-commerce application from scratch can be a complex task, involving various components such as user management, product listings, shopping carts, and order processing.

Imagine you are tasked with creating an e-commerce application that empowers both customers and administrators. The goal is to build a user-friendly platform where customers can effortlessly browse products, add them to their shopping carts, and place orders. Simultaneously, administrators should have tools to manage product inventory, track orders, and ensure a seamless shopping experience.

To tackle this challenge, we will leverage the power of Python and two essential libraries: Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Flask is a lightweight web framework that simplifies web application development, while Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a robust toolkit for database interactions. Together, they form the perfect duo to craft our e-commerce solution.

In this project, we will guide you through the process of building an e-commerce application that closely mimics real-world scenarios.
